call them what you wish to suit your requirements.  Moreover, you can change the display text of a status at any point in tme
without affecting your system.  So if you do not particularly like the status description <strong>Inactive</strong> and instead
would like to call it <strong>Deactivated</strong> for example, you can do so at any point.</p>

editing his record.  Don't worrry, the client user never sees it since it is hidden from him.</p>
