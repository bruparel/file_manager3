call them what you wish to suit your requirements.  Moreover, you can change the display text of a status at any point in tme
without affecting your system.  So if you do not particularly like the status description <strong>Archived</strong> and instead
would like to call it <strong>Stored</strong> for example, you can do so at any point.</p>

when creating or editing a document record.</p>
